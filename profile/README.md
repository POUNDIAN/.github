## Calls for Contribution

The following are a list of tickets open to everyone. If you are interested in resolving any of them, please contact mail@poundian.com. All contributors are listed on the website at [poundian.com/about](https://poundian.com/about).

__The Gaudier-Brzeska Profile SVG__

The imaged used in the header is currently a shoddy digital version of Gaudier-Brzeska’s drawing of Pound. We would like a better version to be supplied, ideally in .svg format.

__A New Font__

Currently the website uses Dante Monotype (+ Dante Monotype Titling for headings). Currently DanteMTTitling breaks the website: it does not have a glyph for the apostrophe, `’` or `'`. In the spirit of the modern, I think a sans-serif font would suit the project better. Any suggestions for fonts are welcome. Even better if someone wanted to make one.

## Resources Online

_This is not a sufficient place to define our desired dataset, nor source it. This is just a note._

__Modjourn__

[Modernist Journals Project](https://modjourn.org/) hosts digitised versions of a number of modernist journals that might be of interest to us, including Blast, Poetry (till 1922), Des Imagistes (+ Some Imagist Poets, Catholic Anthology and Pathology des Dommagistes), The Egoist, The English Review, The Little Review, The New Age, Others, and more. The most obvious omission is The Dial.
